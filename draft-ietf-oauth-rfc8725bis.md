--- abstract


 JSON Web Tokens, also known as JWTs, are URL-safe JSON-based security
 tokens that contain a set of claims that can be signed and/or encrypted.
 JWTs are being widely used and deployed as a simple security token
 format in numerous protocols and applications, both in the area of
 digital identity and in other application areas.  This Best Current
 Practices (BCP) specification updates RFC 7519 to provide actionable guidance
 leading to secure implementation and deployment of JWTs.

 This BCP specification furthermore replaces the existing JWT BCP
 specification RFC 8725 to provide additional actionable guidance
 covering threats and attacks that have been discovered
 since RFC 8725 was published.

# Introduction {#introduction}


 JSON Web Tokens, also known as JWTs  {{RFC7519}}, are URL-safe JSON-based security tokens
that contain a set of claims that can be signed and/or encrypted.
The JWT specification has seen rapid adoption because it encapsulates
security-relevant information in one easy-to-protect location, and because
it is easy to implement using widely available tools.
One application area in which JWTs are commonly used is representing digital identity information,
such as OpenID Connect ID Tokens  {{OpenID.Core}}
and OAuth 2.0  {{RFC6749}} access tokens and
 refresh tokens, the details of which are deployment-specific.

 Since the JWT specification was published, there have been several widely published
attacks on implementations and deployments.
Such attacks are the result of under-specified security mechanisms, as well as incomplete
implementations and incorrect usage by applications.

 The goal of this document is to facilitate secure implementation and deployment of JWTs.
Many of the recommendations in this document are about
implementation and use of the cryptographic mechanisms underlying JWTs that are defined by
JSON Web Signature (JWS)  {{RFC7515}},
JSON Web Encryption (JWE)  {{RFC7516}}, and
JSON Web Algorithms (JWA)  {{RFC7518}}.
Others are about use of the JWT claims themselves.

 These are intended to be minimum recommendations for the use of JWTs
in the vast majority of implementation
and deployment scenarios. Other specifications that reference this document can have
stricter requirements related to one or more aspects of the format, based on their
particular circumstances; when that is the case, implementers are advised to adhere
to those stricter requirements. Furthermore, this document provides a floor, not a ceiling,
so stronger options are always allowed (e.g., depending on differing evaluations of the
importance of cryptographic strength vs. computational load).

 Community knowledge about the strength of various algorithms and feasible attacks can
change quickly, and experience shows that a Best Current Practice (BCP) document about
security is a point-in-time statement. Readers are advised to seek out any errata or
updates that apply to this document.


## Target Audience {#target-audience}


 The intended audiences of this document are:

 used by those libraries),

 * Implementers of code that uses such libraries (to the extent that some mechanisms may
not be provided by libraries, or until they are), and

 * Developers of specifications that rely on JWTs, both inside and
 outside the IETF.

# Threats and Vulnerabilities {#threats-and-vulnerabilities}


 This section lists some known and possible problems with JWT
 implementations and deployments.
Each problem description is followed by references to one or more mitigations to those problems.


## Weak Signatures and Insufficient Signature Validation {#weak-signatures-and-insufficient-signature-validation}


 Signed JSON Web Tokens carry an explicit indication of the signing algorithm,
in the form of the "alg" Header Parameter, to facilitate cryptographic agility.
This, in conjunction with design flaws in some libraries and applications,
 has led to several attacks:


 * The algorithm can be changed to "none" by an attacker, and some libraries would trust
this value and "validate" the JWT without checking any signature.

 * An "RS256" (RSA, 2048 bit) parameter value can be changed into
"HS256" (HMAC, SHA-256), and some libraries
would try to validate the signature using HMAC-SHA256 and using the RSA public key as the
HMAC shared secret (see  {{McLean}} and
  {{CVE-2015-9235}}).

For mitigations, see {{algorithm-verification}} and {{appropriate-algorithms}}.


## Weak Symmetric Keys {#weak-symmetric-keys}


 In addition, some applications use a keyed Message Authentication
 Code (MAC) algorithm, such as
"HS256", to sign tokens but supply a weak symmetric key with
insufficient entropy (such as a human-memorable password). Such keys
are vulnerable to offline brute-force or dictionary attacks once an
attacker gets hold of such a token  {{Langkemper}}.

 For mitigations, see  {{key-entropy}}.




## Incorrect Use and Composition of Encryption and Signature {#incorrect-composition-of-encryption-and-signature}

Most authentication use cases only require a simple signed JWT as their token. However verifiers don't always check that the received JWT is a signed JWS as opposed to an encrypted JWE structure. This can result in vulnerabilities when the verifier's library does not distinguish between successful decryption and successful signature validation {{CVE-2023-51774}}.

In the more complicated use cases where confidentiality is required, some libraries that decrypt a JWE-encrypted JWT to obtain a JWS-signed object
do not always validate the internal signature.

For mitigations, see  {{validate-crypto}}.

## Plaintext Leakage through Analysis of Ciphertext Length {#plaintext-leakage-through-analysis-of-ciphertext-length}


 Many encryption algorithms leak information about the length of the
 plaintext, with a varying amount of
leakage depending on the algorithm and mode of operation. This problem is exacerbated
when the plaintext is initially compressed, because the length of the
compressed plaintext and, thus,
the ciphertext
depends not only on the length of the original plaintext but also
on its content.
Compression attacks are particularly
powerful when there is attacker-controlled data in the same compression
space as secret data, which is the case for some attacks on HTTPS.

 See  {{Kelsey}} for general background
on compression and encryption and  {{Alawatugoda}} for a specific example of attacks on HTTP cookies.

 For mitigations, see  {{no-compression}}.




## Insecure Use of Elliptic Curve Encryption {#insecure-use-of-elliptic-curve-encryption}


 Per  {{Sanso}}, several Javascript
 Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE) libraries
 fail to validate their inputs correctly
when performing elliptic curve key agreement (the "ECDH-ES" algorithm).
An attacker that is able to send JWEs of its choosing that use invalid curve points and
observe the cleartext outputs resulting from decryption with the invalid curve points
can use this vulnerability to recover the recipient's private key.

 For mitigations, see  {{validate-inputs}}.




## Multiplicity of JSON Encodings {#multiplicity-of-json-encodings}


 Previous versions of the JSON format, such as the obsoleted  {{RFC7159}},
allowed several different character
encodings: UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32. This is not the case anymore, with the latest
standard  {{RFC8259}} only allowing UTF-8 except
for internal use within a "closed ecosystem".
This ambiguity, where older implementations and those used within closed environments may generate
non-standard encodings, may result in the JWT being
misinterpreted by its recipient. This, in turn, could be used by a malicious sender to bypass
the recipient's validation checks.

 For mitigations, see  {{use-utf8}}.




## Substitution Attacks {#substitution}


 There are attacks in which one recipient will be given a JWT that was intended for it
and will attempt to use it at a different recipient for which that JWT was not intended.
For instance, if an OAuth 2.0  {{RFC6749}} access
token is legitimately presented to an
OAuth 2.0 protected resource for which it is intended, that protected resource might then present
that same access token to a different protected resource for which the access token is not intended,
in an attempt to gain access. If such situations are not caught, this can result in
the attacker gaining access to resources that it is not entitled to access.

 For mitigations, see Sections  {{<validate-iss-sub}} and  {{<use-aud}}.




## Cross-JWT Confusion {#cross-jwt-confusion}


 As JWTs are being used by more different protocols in diverse
 application areas, it becomes increasingly
important to prevent cases of JWT tokens that have been issued for one purpose
being subverted and used for another.
Note that this is a specific type of substitution attack.
If the JWT could be used in an application context in which it could be
confused with other kinds of JWTs,
then mitigations  MUST be employed to prevent these substitution attacks.

 For mitigations, see Sections  {{<validate-iss-sub}},  {{<use-aud}},  {{<use-typ}}, and  {{<preventing-confusion}}.




## Indirect Attacks on the Server {#indirect-attacks-on-the-server}


 Various JWT claims are used by the recipient to perform lookup operations,
such as database and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) searches.
Others include URLs that are similarly looked up by the server. Any of these claims can be used by
an attacker as vectors for injection attacks or server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks.

 For mitigations, see  {{do-not-trust-claims}}.

## Computation Cost of Unreasonable Number of Hash Iterations {#unreasonable-iterations}

The `p2c` (PBES2 Count) header parameter for the PBES2 encryption algorithms
specifies the number of iterative hash computations to be performed.
Attackers can use a very large count,
thereby imposing an unreasonable computational burden on recipients.

For mitigations, see {{limit-iterations}}.


## Algorithm Verification Code Not Defensively Written

Some JWT implementations included a list of disallowed algorithm names,
e.g., do not use "none".
These same applications misinterpreted
the JOSE specifications when parsing the token, reading algorithm values
as if they were case-insensitive. The end result was that an attacker
could change the "alg" value to "noNE" and bypass the security check.

For mitigations, see {{algorithm-verification}}.

## JWE Decompression Bomb Attack


JWE supports the optional compression of the plaintext prior to encryption via the "zip" header parameter as defined in {{RFC7516}} Section 4.1.3. Upon decryption, recipients are expected to decompress the payload before further processing. However, if the recipient does not enforce limits on the size of the decompressed output, an attacker can craft a malicious JWE with a highly compressed, arbitrarily large payload. This can cause excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory), resulting in Denial of Service (DoS).

For mitigation, see {{limit-decompression}}.


## JWT Format Confusion

Some JWS implementations support both the Compact and JSON Serializations. While JWTs MUST use the Compact Serialization, if an application by mistake verifies a JWT using the JSON Serialization but extracts claims by parsing it as a JWT using the Compact Serialization (e.g., via string splitting), an attacker can craft a valid JSON JWS with a forged payload. This mismatch in format handling can lead to authentication bypass or impersonation.

For mitigations, see {{token-format}}.


# Best Practices {#BP}


 The best practices listed below should be applied by practitioners
to mitigate the threats listed in the preceding section.


## Perform Algorithm Verification {#algorithm-verification}

 Libraries  MUST enable the caller to specify a
 supported set of algorithms and  MUST NOT use any other algorithms when performing cryptographic operations.
The library  MUST ensure that the "alg" or "enc" header specifies the same algorithm
that is used for the cryptographic operation.
Moreover, each key  MUST be used with exactly one algorithm,
and this  MUST be checked when the cryptographic operation is performed.

Libraries SHOULD opt for defensive security policies to cope
with potential issues in the underlying infrastructure, such
as the JSON parser. In particular, use allowlists for critical
parameters such as "alg" instead of blocklists.


## Use Appropriate Algorithms {#appropriate-algorithms}


 As  Section 5.2 of {{RFC7515}} says,
"it is an application decision which algorithms may
be used in a given context. Even if a JWS can be successfully
validated, unless the algorithm(s) used in the JWS are acceptable to
the application, it  SHOULD consider the JWS to be invalid."

 Therefore, applications  MUST only allow the use of
 cryptographically current algorithms
that meet the security requirements of the application.
This set will vary over time as new algorithms are introduced
and existing algorithms are deprecated due to discovered cryptographic weaknesses.
Applications  MUST therefore be designed to enable cryptographic agility.

 That said, if a JWT is cryptographically protected end-to-end by a
 transport layer, such as TLS
using cryptographically current algorithms, there may be no need to apply another layer of
cryptographic protections to the JWT.
In such cases, the use of the "none" algorithm can be perfectly acceptable.
The "none" algorithm should only be used when the JWT is cryptographically protected by other means.
JWTs using "none" are often used in application contexts in which the content is optionally signed;
then, the URL-safe claims representation and processing can be the same in both
the signed and unsigned cases.
JWT libraries  SHOULD NOT generate JWTs using "none" unless
explicitly requested to do so by the caller.
Similarly, JWT libraries  SHOULD NOT consume JWTs using "none"
 unless explicitly requested by the caller.

 Applications  SHOULD follow these algorithm-specific recommendations:


 * Avoid all RSA-PKCS1 v1.5 encryption algorithms ({{RFC8017}}, Section 7.2), preferring
 RSAES-OAEP
 ({{RFC8017}}, Section 7.1).

 * Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signatures  {{ANSI-X962-2005}} require a unique random value for
every message
 that is signed.
If even just a few bits of the random value are predictable across multiple messages, then
the security of the signature scheme may be compromised. In the worst case,
the private key may be recoverable by an attacker. To counter these attacks,
JWT libraries  SHOULD implement ECDSA using the deterministic
approach defined in  {{RFC6979}}.
This approach is completely compatible with existing ECDSA verifiers and so can be implemented
without new algorithm identifiers being required.





## Validate All Cryptographic Operations {#validate-crypto}

All cryptographic operations used in the JWT MUST be validated and the entire JWT MUST be rejected
if any of them fail to validate.
This is true not only of JWTs with a single set of Header Parameters
but also for Nested JWTs in which both outer and inner operations  MUST be validated
using the keys and algorithms supplied by the application.

Libraries MUST allow the verifier to distinguish between JWS-signed and JWE-encrypted JWTs.
This would allow verifiers to easily establish a policy of only accepting JWS-signed JWTs.

## Validate Cryptographic Inputs {#validate-inputs}


 Some cryptographic operations, such as Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement
("ECDH-ES"), take inputs that may contain invalid values. This includes points not on
the specified elliptic curve
or other invalid points (e.g.,  {{Valenta}}, Section 7.1).
The JWS/JWE library itself must validate these inputs before using them,
or it must use underlying cryptographic libraries that do so (or both!).

 Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral Static (ECDH-ES) ephemeral
 public key (epk) inputs should be validated
 according to the recipient's
chosen elliptic curve. For the NIST prime-order curves P-256, P-384, and P-521,
validation  MUST
be performed according to Section 5.6.2.3.4 (ECC Partial Public-Key Validation
Routine) of "Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key-Establishment Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm Cryptography"
{{nist-sp-800-56a-r3}}.
If the "X25519" or "X448"  {{RFC8037}} algorithms are used,
then the security considerations in  {{RFC8037}} apply.




## Ensure Cryptographic Keys Have Sufficient Entropy {#key-entropy}


 The Key Entropy and Random Values advice in  Section 10.1 of {{RFC7515}} and the
 Password Considerations in  Section 8.8 of {{RFC7518}}
  MUST be followed.
In particular, human-memorizable passwords  MUST NOT be directly used
as the key to a keyed-MAC algorithm such as "HS256".
Moreover, passwords should only be used to perform key encryption, rather
than content encryption,
as described in  Section 4.8 of {{RFC7518}}.
Note that even when used for key encryption, password-based encryption is
 still subject to brute-force attacks.




## Avoid Compression of Encryption Inputs {#no-compression}


 Compression of data  SHOULD NOT be done before encryption, because
such compressed data often reveals information about the plaintext.




## Use UTF-8 {#use-utf8}


 {{RFC7515}},  {{RFC7516}}, and  {{RFC7519}} all
 specify that UTF-8 be used for encoding and decoding JSON
used in Header Parameters and JWT Claims Sets. This is also in line with the
latest JSON specification  {{RFC8259}}.
Implementations and applications  MUST do this and not use or admit the use of
other Unicode encodings for these purposes.




## Validate Issuer and Subject {#validate-iss-sub}


 When a JWT contains an "iss" (issuer) claim, the application
  MUST validate that the cryptographic keys
used for the cryptographic operations in the JWT belong to the issuer.
If they do not, the application  MUST reject the JWT.

 The means of determining the keys owned by an issuer is application-specific.
As one example, OpenID Connect  {{OpenID.Core}}
issuer values are "https" URLs
that reference a JSON metadata document that contains a "jwks_uri" value that is
an "https" URL from which the issuer's keys are retrieved as a JWK Set  {{RFC7517}}.
This same mechanism is used by  {{RFC8414}}.
Other applications may use different means of binding keys to issuers.

 Similarly, when the JWT contains a "sub" (subject) claim, the
 application  MUST validate that
the subject value corresponds to a valid subject and/or issuer-subject pair at the application.
This may include confirming that the issuer is trusted by the application.
If the issuer, subject, or the pair are invalid, the application
  MUST reject the JWT.




## Use and Validate Audience {#use-aud}


 If the same issuer can issue JWTs that are intended for use by more
 than one relying party or application,
the JWT  MUST contain an "aud" (audience) claim that can be used
to determine whether the JWT
is being used by an intended party or was substituted by an attacker at an unintended party.

 In such cases, the relying party or application  MUST
 validate the audience value,
and if the audience value is not present or not associated with the recipient,
it  MUST reject the JWT.




## Do Not Trust Received Claims {#do-not-trust-claims}


 The "kid" (key ID) header is used by the relying application to
 perform key lookup. Applications
should ensure that this does not create SQL or LDAP injection vulnerabilities by validating
and/or sanitizing the received value.

 Similarly, blindly following a "jku" (JWK set URL) or "x5u" (X.509 URL) header,
which may contain an arbitrary URL,
could result in server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks. Applications SHOULD protect against such
attacks, e.g., by matching the URL to a whitelist of allowed locations
and ensuring no cookies are sent in the GET request.




## Use Explicit Typing {#use-typ}


 Sometimes, one kind of JWT can be confused for another. If a particular
kind of JWT is subject to such confusion, that JWT can include an explicit
JWT type value, and the validation rules can specify checking the type.
This mechanism can prevent such confusion.
Explicit JWT typing is accomplished by using the "typ" Header Parameter.
For instance, the  {{RFC8417}} specification uses
the "application/secevent+jwt" media type
to perform explicit typing of Security Event Tokens (SETs).

 Per the definition of "typ" in  Section 4.1.9 of {{RFC7515}},
it is  RECOMMENDED that the "application/" prefix be omitted from the "typ" value.
Therefore, for example, the "typ" value used to explicitly include a type for a SET SHOULD be "secevent+jwt".
When explicit typing is employed for a JWT, it is  RECOMMENDED
that a media type name of the format
"application/example+jwt" be used, where "example" is replaced by the
 identifier for the specific kind of JWT.

 When applying explicit typing to a Nested JWT, the "typ" Header
 Parameter containing the explicit type value  MUST be present in the inner JWT of the Nested JWT (the JWT
whose payload is the JWT Claims Set).
In some cases, the same "typ" Header Parameter value will be present in the outer JWT as well,
to explicitly type the entire Nested JWT.

 Note that the use of explicit typing may not achieve disambiguation
 from existing kinds of JWTs,
as the validation rules for existing kinds of JWTs often do not use the "typ" Header Parameter value.
Explicit typing is  RECOMMENDED for new uses of JWTs.




## Use Mutually Exclusive Validation Rules for Different Kinds of JWTs {#preventing-confusion}


 Each application of JWTs defines a profile specifying the required
 and optional JWT claims
and the validation rules associated with them.
If more than one kind of JWT can be issued by the same issuer,
the validation rules for those JWTs  MUST be written such that
they are mutually exclusive,
rejecting JWTs of the wrong kind.
To prevent substitution of JWTs from one context into another,
application developers may employ a number of strategies:


 * Use explicit typing for different kinds of JWTs.
Then the distinct "typ" values can be used to differentiate between the
 different kinds of JWTs.

 * Use different sets of required claims or different required claim values.
Then the validation rules for one kind of JWT will reject those with different
 claims or values.

 * Use different sets of required Header Parameters or different
 required Header Parameter values.
Then the validation rules for one kind of JWT will reject those with different
 Header Parameters or values.

 * Use different keys for different kinds of JWTs.
Then the keys used to validate one kind of JWT will fail to validate other kinds of JWTs.

 * Use different "aud" values for different uses of JWTs from the same issuer.
Then audience validation will reject JWTs substituted into inappropriate contexts.

 * Use different issuers for different kinds of JWTs.
Then the distinct "iss" values can be used to segregate the different kinds of JWTs.


 Given the broad diversity of JWT usage and applications,
the best combination of types, required claims, values, Header Parameters, key usages, and issuers
to differentiate among different kinds of JWTs
will, in general, be application-specific.
As discussed in  {{use-typ}}, for new JWT
 applications, the use of explicit typing is
  RECOMMENDED.


## Limit Hash Iteration Count {#limit-iterations}

Implementations are RECOMMENDED to set a reasonable upper limit on
the number of hash iterations that can be performed
when validating encrypted content using PBES2 encryption algorithms,
so as to prevent attackers from imposing
an unreasonable computational burden on recipients.
{{OWASP-Password-Storage}} states that an iteration count of 600,000 is required when using HMAC-SHA-256 to achieve FIPS-140 compliance.
Thus, rejecting inputs with a `p2c` (PBES2 Count) value over 1,200,000 (double that) is RECOMMENDED.

## Check JWT Format Type {#token-format}

Implementations MUST confirm the JWT is in a legal format while parsing it. Legal JWTs contain only the ASCII characters for letters, numbers, dash, underscore, and period.  Content with any other characters - especially braces and quotation marks - is not a JWT and MUST be rejected.


## Limit JWE Decompression Size {#limit-decompression}

Implementations are RECOMMENDED to set a reasonable upper limit on the decompressed size of a JWE such as 250 KB.
