The root cause of this issue is that there is no limit on the size of the p2c claim in the JWE encrypted by the PBES2 algorithm, which causes the server to run billions of hash calculations when decrypting the JWE, causing a denial of service attack. Therefore, we propose adding a warning about this threat in RFC8725 and recommending an upper limit on the size of the p2c claim to mitigate the risk.\r\n",

If the user extracts the payload by string interception after verification, the attacker can forge the content, which leads to JWT Format Confusion. We found such an exploitation case in Openshift Telemeter (CVE-2024-5037[1]) and Kubernetes identity verification[2] that supports parsing JSON JWS and leading to authentication bypass. Therefore, we propose to include this threat in RFC8725 for systematic consideration and advise against parsing JSON JWSs.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2024-5037\r\n[2]: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/123540",

However, we observed that 13 libraries did not check the length of the JWE when decompressing it. This means that an attacker can encrypt a very long and malicious JWT and send it to the recipient, causing a denial of service attack. Therefore, we suggest adding this issue in RFC8725 and recommending a upper limit on the length of JWE.",

During our testing, we found two libraries are vulnerable to this issue where attackers use public key encrypted JWE to bypass the parsing of JWT using asymmetric encryption algorithms. The root cause of this security issue is that the JWK implemented allows both public and private keys to be included, resulting in a bypass even if the algorithm is verified according to the method mentioned in RFC8725 3.1 (check whether the RSA algorithm is used). Therefore, we propose adding a warning about this threat in RFC8725 and advising developers not to include both public and private keys in JWK, and check the \"use\" claim in JWK before parsing JWT.",

I'd like to understand the nature of the problem before talking about solutions.\r\n\r\nThat said, it's normal to use claims from the payload - in particular, the `iss` claim - in the procedure to retrieve the keys.  For instance, [Obtaining OpenID Provider Configuration Information](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderConfig) requires appending `.well-known/openid-configuration` to the `iss` claim value in an ID Token as part of the process of retrieving the signing keys.  This is a feature - not a bug - as it guarantees that the keys belong to the issuer.\r\n\r\nOur target audience should be all kinds of developers - both library and application developers.",
